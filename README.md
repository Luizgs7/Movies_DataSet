# Movies Data Set

This project aims to create a movie dataset from the TMDB API so that it can be used in my personal Data Science projects.


## Tables:

(Put the column structure here)

- movies_df.csv:
- movies_genres.csv
- movies_production_companies.csv
- movies_production_coutries.csv
- movies_spoken_languages.csv


## Images

The download_movie_posters.py file downloads movie posters that have been extracted from the API and stored in the movies_df.csv file

## Back log

- Bring provider data for each movie (Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc)
